Esp8266 IR Daikin AC Control

## Intro
Control Daikin Ar-Conditioning with an ESP8266 and infra-red emitter.
Also we have this options:
  * Receive infra-red from remote control of AC
  * Receive Information from PIR sensor
  * Receive Temperature e Humidity of DHT22
  * Receive Lighting nivel from LDR
Use MQTT to receive and send information to ESP8266 and MQTT Server

## Hardware
* NodeMCU board ESP8266 WiFi module ESP-12E Lua WiFi
* PIR Motion Sensor Module
* Infrared Receiver 38KHz 
* Infrared Emitter 940nm
* LDR - Light Controlled Resistor 1Mohm
* DHT22 temperature-humidity sensor
* Transistor 2N222
* Resistor 10Kohm
